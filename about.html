                    To use this app you must allow access of you microphone to the browser. You then start to speak and if you feel vibrations it means you're suppose to speak up! This will also be indicated by a red volume bar. If the volume bar is green, then you're all set! You shouldn't feel any vibrations.

                    Why you should use
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This app is a tool to help prepare for presentations as well as to use during presentations. What the website does is make sure that you're talking loud enough to be heard. This is important especially for people who are softspoken to make sure they are percieved as confident and to also make sure everyone will be able to hear you. This is also a a great tool to practice and get use to projecting your voice before you present. The app could also be useful to musicans. Musicans could check wether they're playing pianismo or fortismo which is just soft or loud in terms of dynamics.

            <p>
               VoizTrainer is a web program used to practice your public speaking. The idea comes from Kevin Li a Mechanical Engineering major who wanted to help people who are soft spoken practice speaking up. Our team consets of the following people, Kevin Li a Mechical Engineering major, Zhen Yi Pan a Computer Science major, Angel Velazquez someone who is intending to major in Computer Science, and Sebastian Houlgen who is also intending to major in Computer Science. Our team utalized HTML, CSS, and Javascript to bring our idea to life. This idea is rough around the edges but it was somewhat a new position to everyone.
